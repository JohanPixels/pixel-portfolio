                I came to programming unexpectedly—a couple of YouTube videos at
                the end of high school sparked the right kind of curiosity. From
                working in a family bakery to writing full-stack code.
            </p>
            <p style="color: var(--text);">
                I started fascinated by frontend: watching designs come to life,
                every detail in its place. But I quickly understood I needed to
                master backend to build things that actually work. Automation
                came with my first job—not my original plan, but it showed me
                the value of optimizing processes and giving people their time
                back.
            </p>
            <p style="color: var(--text);">
                Today I build everything from carefully crafted interfaces to
                systems that scale. What drives me is creating tools with real
                impact, not just writing code for the sake of it. Full-stack to
                me means understanding how to connect all the pieces to solve
                complete problems.
